                            <p>Nguyen Anh Minh is currently taking her last course at RMIT as well as doing an internship at a start-up logistics provider. Anh Minh and Minh Anh together gave birth to the idea of Mi Casa. She is also the main Front-end developer and User Experience Designer for Mi Casa.</p>  
                            <p>In her free time, she would go out for a walk or bike-ride, play open-world action games, listen to music, or play jigsaw puzzles.</p>
                            <p>Through her studying and working experiences, she has learnt how technology could greatly facilitate business operations and the supply chain specifically, along with leverage the stand of a firm towards competitors. Consequently, Minh becomes fascinated in exploring how IT can be utilised to optimise a supply chain. In the past, she was taught Pascal in secondary school. Furthermore, she once tried to study C++ but due to the low possibility of realistic application in her intended career path, she gave it up to make time for supply chain studies.</p>

Minh Anh has some basic understanding about IT applications and used to try learning Python but since it is not really relevant to her major, she did not have any chances to apply it into any project.</p>

                        <p>During the study journey at RMIT and his internship experiences at 3 different companies, he has observed the importance of IT in the success of businesses. In fact, IT is involved in every stage of the supply chain, from raw-material acquisition to the final distribution to customers. Although IT is not his major, He has researched some of the most prominent IT trends, such as big data, IOTs, AI, advanced robotics, and blockchain, but has not participated in any IT project before.
